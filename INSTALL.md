(You can use `background.js` Line 13893 as a reference point)

## Here is the not so helpfull installation guide

You can download the source files from the releases, or zip the repository.

Chromium won't allow you to use an extension that is not from the webstore. (Btw. use [Brave](https://brave.com/), it is better privacy (You can turn off all the Crypto features))

You will have to use **Developer Mode** and **Load unpacked** features to get the extensions to work:
1. Download and unzip this repository wherever you are comportable eg. `~/Documents/MyBrowserExtensions/`
1. Go to Settings->Extensions->(Menage Extensions)
2. Enable Developer toggle on the top right, the option "Load Unpacked" should appear in the top left.
3. Click it, and choose the PrivateNoteTab folder you just unziped.
4. Figure out any popups that appear
5. You should be done, reopen/restart your browser if necessary, and turn on the extension.
